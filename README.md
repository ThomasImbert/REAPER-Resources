# Thomas Imbert's resources for Reaper

A collection of SWS Cycle actions, Custom actions and other resources for Reaper.

Especially useful when using my VASC (Voice Acting Spreadsheet Connect) tool, which you can find here: 

     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThomasImbert/REAPER-ReaScripts/master/index.xml

## Necessary Extensions

To use these actions, you have to install SWS and Reapack extensions for Reaper.

SWS:
https://www.sws-extension.org/

Reapack:
https://reapack.com/

## Setup

Once installed, import my Reascripts repository in Reapack:

Copy and paste this URL in Extensions > ReaPack > Import a repository:

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThomasImbert/REAPER-ReaScripts/master/index.xml

Make sure to install the actual scripts once the repository is imported.

The cycle and custom actions use scripts from multiple creators, all found in Reapack.

To get up and running, repeat the last step for the following repositories and install all of their scripts. If you want to avoid installing too many script, a precise script list for each custom or cycle action can be found below.
